This is a FunCaptcha generator for roblox account creaton written in Javascript!

[Here's a version written in python! (Made by Roblox-Thot)](https://github.com/Roblox-Thot/captchaCodeMakerV2)

# Installation:
You'll need Node.js v16 or newer for running this.

Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies. (express and node-fetch)

Once it has finished installing the dependencies you may start the server with `npm start` 

# Example scripts:
There is a example folder with two contents:

    + accountMaker.js
    + accountMaker.py

These two are scripts for creating accounts with the captcha id and token encoded in base64.

# Extra info:
The captcha token and captcha id that the page provides are encoded in base64, you'll need to decode them if you want to use this in your own project.
